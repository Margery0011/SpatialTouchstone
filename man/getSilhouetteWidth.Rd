\title{getSilhouetteWidth.}
\usage{
getSilhouetteWidth(seu_obj)
}
\arguments{
\item{seu_obj}{A Seurat object.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the \code{sample_id}, \code{platform},
and the average silhouette width across all clusters, rounded to three decimal places.
}
\description{
It calculates silhouette width as cluster evaluation.
}
\details{
The silhouette width calculation involves preprocessing steps including normalization and scaling of the data, PCA for dimensionality reduction, and clustering.
The silhouette width is then calculated for a downsampled subset of cells to ensure computational efficiency.
This metric helps in assessing the cohesion and separation of the identified clusters, with higher values indicating better defined clusters.
